                "description": "---\r\n\r\nUse this request to look up a list group, which is a nested object structure that defines the options available in a chain of cascading list form controls. (Cascading lists are a set of &lt;select&gt; elements where only the first one is initially enabled until an option in it is selected, and then, depending on which option was selected, the available options in the next list can vary.) Each property in the structure represents an option in a select list, and its children represent options that become available in the next list in the chain if that option is selected.\r\n\r\n### Sample Explanation\r\n\r\nThe sample for the 200 response shows an example of a list group that could be assigned to 3 controls in a form to let the user pick an American football team by conference, division, and name. Since the result has two properties (\"AFC\" and \"NFC\") as direct children of the \"optionsTree\" property, the first list in the cascading list chain would have two options--\"AFC\" and \"NFC\".  Whichever option is chosen, its child properties become available for selection in the second list, and so forth.  For example, if \"AFC\" and \"North\" were chosen for the first two lists respectively, the third list would show the available options \"Bengals\", \"Browns\", \"Ravens\", and \"Steelers\".  These four properties just have empty objects as their values because this particular list group only has three layers; these options are the final options in the chain and have no descendants.\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires *Authorization* header with valid Bearer token for scope *issues:read*.\r\n\r\n---",

Currently 'pdf' is the only supported file type. The IDs of the issues must be specified in a query string parameter named \"ids\", separated by commas if there is more than one. A sample request URL that exports 3 issues to a PDF is as follows--\r\n\r\nhttps://api.bentley.com/issues/exportPdfToStorage?ids=abab23524535,89458jjlij,32636wtewtwt&folderId=090909877987&includeHeader=true\r\n\r\nNote that unlike most GET requests, this is not an idempotent operation; each time it is called, a new file will be generated. The response will not contain the file itself, but links to download it from Storage.\r\n\r\nAll issues specified in the request must come from the same project, or the request will fail. The client may also specify the ID of a destination folder where the file should be saved; otherwise, it will be saved in the project's root folder.  They can also specify whether to include a textual header with issue metadata at the top of each page (default) or exclude it.\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires *Authorization* header with valid Bearer token for scope *issues:read*.\r\n\r\n---",
